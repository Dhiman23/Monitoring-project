# Monitoring Project üìä

Welcome to the Monitoring Project! This repository contains a comprehensive monitoring setup using Prometheus, Node Exporter, Alertmanager, and Blackbox Exporter to ensure the health and performance of your virtual machines (VMs) and services. This setup includes alerting via Gmail for critical conditions such as VM crashes, storage issues, CPU overloads, website downtimes, and specific service failures.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a robust monitoring solution for virtual machines and their hosted services. By leveraging Prometheus and its exporters, we can gather metrics and send alerts when specific conditions are met, ensuring proactive incident management.

## Architecture

The architecture of this monitoring setup consists of the following components:

- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics.
- **Node Exporter**: Exposes hardware and OS metrics.
- **Alertmanager**: Handles alerts and notifications.
- **Blackbox Exporter**: Probes endpoints (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for availability and performance.

## Components

### Prometheus

Prometheus is the core component that scrapes metrics from various exporters and stores them. It provides a powerful querying language (PromQL) to analyze the metrics and set up alerting rules.

### Node Exporter

Node Exporter is used to collect hardware and OS-level metrics from the VM. This includes CPU, memory, disk usage, and more.

### Alertmanager

Alertmanager handles the alerts generated by Prometheus. It supports routing, grouping, and sending notifications via various channels, including email.

### Blackbox Exporter

Blackbox Exporter allows you to probe endpoints like websites or services to check their availability and response time.

## Alert Conditions

The monitoring setup includes the following alert conditions, which will trigger notifications via Gmail:

1. **VM Crash** üö®: Alerts when a VM becomes unreachable.
2. **No Storage Left** üíæ: Alerts when a VM's disk usage reaches critical levels.
3. **CPU Overload** üß†: Alerts when a VM's CPU usage is excessively high.
4. **Website Down** üåê: Alerts when a monitored website is not reachable.
5. **Specific Service Down** ‚öôÔ∏è: Alerts when a specified service on a VM is not running.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- A Gmail account for sending notifications.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monitoring-project.git
    cd monitoring-project
    ```

2. **Deploy with Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Configuration

1. **Prometheus**: Configure the `prometheus.yml` file to include your targets (VMs, services, etc.).

2. **Alertmanager**: Update the `alertmanager.yml` file with your Gmail credentials and routing rules.

3. **Blackbox Exporter**: Modify the `blackbox.yml` file to include the endpoints you want to monitor.

4. **Alert Rules**: Define your alerting rules in the `alert.rules` file based on the conditions mentioned above.

## Usage

After the setup is complete, Prometheus will start scraping metrics from Node Exporter and Blackbox Exporter. Alerts will be triggered based on the defined conditions and sent to your Gmail account via Alertmanager.

- Access the Prometheus dashboard at `http://localhost:9090`.
- Access the Alertmanager dashboard at `http://localhost:9093`.
- Access the Blackbox Exporter at `http://localhost:9115`.
